Welcome to my first post! This website is intended to be a blog (shocking) for me to express any musings that pop into my head - which might be computer related. Possibly not. Probably yes, though.

A bit about myself - my name is Ben, and I just graduated from McGill University in frosty Montreal. Since I've majored in Computer Science (and Economics, but who really cares about that?), I figured I should use a bit of my spare time to create a blog, like every good little software developer should do. A good place to begin is probably with how I made this website:

### The Meta Part; Or, how to build a website without design skills

This website was built as as a statically served website using a static website generator, specifically . Since I've been meaning to create a blog for some time, when I stubmled upon [this website][top_static_gen] I immmediatly sprung into action and picked **[Jekyll][jekyll]** as my static website generator of choice. The advantages to using a static website generator are numerous, and include quick serving speed, quick development speed, and low hosting costs. Since Jekyll is made by the wondering people at [GitHub] [github] (well, [mostly wonderful][github_trouble]), I figured that my best option for hosting is (the free) **[GitHub Pages][github_pages]**. 

That's pretty  much all there is to this website. Right now, I'm using Jekyll's default theme, since it really speaks to my love of simple design. The main thing I added (apart from changing a few of the default colors) is responsive website design support, which was done by using the [Skeleton framwork][skeleton]. If I end up changing the theme vastly at any point, I'll include a link here to its source code. 

Otherwise, it's onwards and codewards!
