Yeepee - first post! Welcome!

This is intended to be a blog that I will use to express my various musings and other things that pop into my head - possibly computer related. Possibly not. Probably yes, though.

A bit about myself - my name is Ben, and I just graduated from McGill University in frosty Montreal. Since I've majored in Computer Science (and Economics, but who really cares about that?), I figured I should use a bit of my spare time to create a nice little programming-related blog, like every good little software developer should do.

A good place to start is to probably describe what I used to create this awesome-looking website. I built it using [Jekyll][jekyll], a static-site generator created by the wonderful people at [Github] [github] (well, [mostly wonderful][github_trouble]). I chose it after stumbling upon [this website][top_static_gen]
